# VeriBits
## The Swiss Army Knife for Security Verification

**Enterprise-Grade Security Verification & Developer Tools Platform**

---

### 🎯 What We Do

VeriBits provides **90+ security verification APIs** and **20+ developer tools** in one unified platform, helping security teams, developers, and compliance professionals verify files, certificates, identities, and code integrity at scale.

**One API. Unlimited Possibilities.**

---

### 💡 The Problem

Organizations waste **$2.3M annually** on fragmented security tools:
- 🔴 Multiple vendors for malware scanning, hash validation, certificate checks
- 🔴 No audit trail for compliance (SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA)
- 🔴 Expensive enterprise-only pricing locks out small teams
- 🔴 Poor developer experience - complex APIs, no CLI tools
- 🔴 Limited visibility into security operations

**Result:** Security gaps, compliance failures, wasted developer time
